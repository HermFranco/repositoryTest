# repositoryTest
My Frontend Test

I created a simple page where we can watch the data from a repository that I selected named "You-Dont-Know-JS"

At the beginning we can se the owner and the repository name, then are the branches with message, author name, message and timestamps.

At the second table we have the commits with author name, and email, message and timestamps.

For the last table we have Pull Requests, with author, title, description and status.

For watching the page please click here in the next link:
